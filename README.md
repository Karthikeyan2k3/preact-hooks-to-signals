## Preact Hooks to Signals

This project contains examples from Preact's guide on the [Hooks section](https://preactjs.com/guide/v10/hooks). only I have rewritten it to leverage the much better signals in place of React hooks like useState, useEffect, useReducer, or useContext.

The official Preact docs are mostly written for React developers who are switching to Preact, so many examples look like React and shows how to use hooks with Preact. Signals are Preactâ€™s feature, which makes the state management easier and reactive.

This repo demonstrates how each of those hook-based examples was rewritten using signals i.e, converted from hooks to signals.
